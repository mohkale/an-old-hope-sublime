# Installation Instructions
The installation procedure varies depending on the program you're
installing for. I've outlined the procedure only for those I've
personally installed it in.

## bat
1. cp `./an-old-hope.tmTheme` to `~/.config/bat/themes/`.
2. create a config file as per the bat [documentation][doc].
3. change the theme option to `"an-old-hope"`.
